# The Price of Smoking Campaign

Every year, tobacco kills up to a half of its users worldwide ([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco)). It kills more than 8 million people, which accounts for 12% of all deaths among adults aged 30 years and over ([source](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco)). The most cost-effective way to reduce tobacco use is to raise taxes ([source](https://www.cgdev.org/publication/single-best-health-policy-world-tobacco-taxes)).

In a country like Ukraine, a tax increase that raises tobacco prices by 10% decreases tobacco consumption by about 5%. It is especially effective among youth and people of low income ([source](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/765671507036953947/regressive-or-progressive-the-effect-of-tobacco-taxes-in-ukraine)).

The Price of Smoking (priceofsmoking.org) is an open source project by the Policy Entrepreneurship Network (policyentrepreneurs.org). It was originally designed for and together with Життя (center-life.org) as an element of a wider campaign to raise tobacco taxes in Ukraine, where the death rate from smoking is among the highest in the world ([source](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rate-smoking)), while the prices are among the lowest ([source](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-price-of-a-pack-of-cigarettes)).

Today, we are excited to offer it to other like-minded advocates around the world.
